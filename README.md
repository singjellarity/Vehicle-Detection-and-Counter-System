# File Exploration
- The [main.py](https://github.com/singjellarity/Vehicle-Detection-and-Counter-System/blob/main/main.py) file contains the Python script that does the vehicle detection and counting. 
- The video source used as input for the script is [FINAL.mp4](https://github.com/singjellarity/Vehicle-Detection-and-Counter-System/blob/main/FINAL.mp4). 
- The file [output.csv](https://github.com/singjellarity/Vehicle-Detection-and-Counter-System/blob/main/output.csv) contains the vehicles counted in CSV format.
- Traffic and vehicle analysis is done with Jupyter notebook file [DS2 Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/singjellarity/Vehicle-Detection-and-Counter-System/blob/main/DS2%20Analysis.ipynb).

# Objectives
- Make an accurate vehicle counter using Python
- To filter pre-recorded traffic video
- Convert the filtered data into quantifiable data
